# aws_scripts

A simple menu script that allows users to create AWS instances with apache servers, S3 buckets, upload files & replace the default homepage with an image of the users choice.

These scripts were developed using python in a linux environment.

To run the scripts type ./menu.py into a terminal.

Python3 will need to be installed & the scripts will need to be made executable using the chmod command. The user will also need to replace config.key & config.aws_security_group will need to be replaced with the users AWS key & the users security group of choice
